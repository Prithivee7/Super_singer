## Introduction
            This is a code repository of a data analysis and visualisation project done on Billboard's year end hot singles from the 
        year 1947 to 2018. The project involves data extraction, preprocessing, analysis and visualisation. 
 
## Walkthrough
            Billboard publishes annual lists of songs based on chart performance over the course of a year based on Nielsen Broadcast 
       Data Systems and SoundScan information. This list consists of ranking, name of the song and the band name.

            Webscrapping was done using beautiful soup to extract ranking, song, song url, band name and the band url. As we have data 
       from 1947 to 2020, scrapping was done for all available years. The url differs only in the year part, which was used to get 
       those pages.
